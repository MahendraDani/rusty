Structs in Rust are used defined types, that can have multiple named-fields with methods and associated functions.

Methods:
The functions in implementation of Structs which have `&self` as the first parameter are called methods.

Associated Functions :
The functions in implementation of Structs which don't have `&self` parameter are called associated functions.
