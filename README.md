# Getting Rusty
This repository contains all the source code and notes I write to learn Rust from [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

Started learning Rust on 31st October 2024.

# Why Rust?
Well, its _fast_, _difficult_, and highly _reputed_ language.
- Most engines and bundlers are written in rust for performace boost.
- Solana ecosystem is in Rust
- Rust can be used for literally everything, CLI, Web apps, embedded systems.
- Adds one more language to my arsenal, giving me opportunities to contribute to Rust based projects like [Graphite](graphite.rs)
- I want to build CLI's in rust,especially the ones in [Jhon Cricket's Coding Challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/intro)
- My goal is to get into GSOC'25 and SOB'25 and having Rust knowledge gives me more opportunites, given that I have enough time (4 months Nov'24-Fev-25) to learn Rust.
